# code skeleton quine

a processing program that produces a stylized version of its source code 

based on the [Simulated Code](https://github.com/erdavids/Simulated-Code) project by [erdavids](https://github.com/erdavids) (aka [u/thebuffed](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebuffed))

_technically_, not a quine, since this reads in itself using python's `__file__` built-in

also, i selected coding practices that would give me a nicer image rather than idiomatic python ðŸ¤·
