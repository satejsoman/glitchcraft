# code skeleton quine

a processing program that produces a stylized version of its source code 

based on the [Simulated Code](https://github.com/erdavids/Simulated-Code) project by [erdavids](https://github.com/erdavids) (aka [u/thebuffed](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebuffed))

notes: 
- _technically_, not a quine, since this reads in itself using python's `__file__` built-in
- replace `__file__` with a different path to stylize a different file
- also, i selected coding practices that would give me a nicer image rather than idiomatic python ðŸ¤·
